Project Description

This project is being developed for submission to the annual school contest organized by a major IT company — the Samsung Innovation Campus. (This year's contest: 2025; previous year: 2024).

The application is built for Android using Java, in accordance with the contest's technical requirements. It is an android app that uses artificial intelligence to generate questions for three well-known game types:

    Truth (a simplified version of “Truth or Dare” without the dares),

    Dare (only dares, no questions),

    NeverEver (based on the “Never Have I Ever” game format).

Each game supports multiple modes — Fun, Soft, Hot, Extreme, and Madness — representing increasing levels of boldness or intensity.

Players can customize the game by entering names and genders of participants. The system also supports dynamic feedback collection: users can add their reactions on AI-generated responses for each game and mode. Additionally, the number of AI responses can be configured independently for each mode of every game.
